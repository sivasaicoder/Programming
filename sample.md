 ### keywords to remember: console, string, variable, statement, condition, execute, indent, block, syntax, 
 ### syntax: if, : , () , print

 It looks like you've provided a code snippet in Python. Let's break down what each part of the code does:


 - print("Hello!, Softwaram")
 * This line prints the string "Hello!, Softwaram" to the console. The exclamation mark and comma are included as part of the string.


 ```python
 x = 1
 if x == 1:
      indented four spaces
     print("x is 1.")>
```

 Here, you define a variable `x` and assign it the value `1`. Then, you have an `if` statement that checks if `x` is equal to `1`. If the condition is true (which it is, since `x` is indeed equal to `1`), it executes the indented block of code under it.

 The indented block `print("x is 1.")` will be executed because the condition `x == 1` is true. Therefore, when you run this code, it will output:

 ```
 Hello!, Softwaram
 x is 1.
 ```

 This assumes that there are no syntax errors or issues with indentation in your actual code file. Python relies on proper indentation to determine the scope of code blocks, so make sure that the `print` statement inside the `if` block is indented correctly by four spaces or one tab character.
